# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Exploratory_Data_Analysis

In generating the four images, create sub-directory called exploratory_data_analysis under current working directory, copy the input text file onto such sub-directory, and run the R scripts from current working directory. The image files will be stored in exploratory_data_analysis. 

- I am wondering why victor-rocha, the owner of pulga-latina and pulga-mobile repositories I forked in the past, is strangely shown as owner of this repository I newly created for this course.
- I experienced problems in pushing my R scripts and images to the forked repository thus I ended up creating this new repository so I could submit my works for evaluation.
